# Pale Moon for Linux installer

- Version __VERSION__

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
- Run the "pminstaller.sh" script from the file manager by double clicking on it. If, however, this does not work for some reason, then open a terminal emulator window, type the following and hit enter.

		~/pminstaller.sh

  (Assuming the "pminstaller.sh" script is placed in the home directory, as instructed above).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to continue.

Notes:

- At this time, pminstaller cannot install the Atom optimized builds of Pale Moon for Linux. You have to manually download them from http://linux.palemoon.org/atom/
- Some file managers treat the pminstaller.sh file as a normal text file and will try to open it as such (in a text editor). In such cases you must run the installer in a terminal using this command: /path/to/the/installer/pminstaller.sh
- Do not invoke the installer as root (e.g. "sudo ./pminstaller.sh"). On some distros, the sudo command will strip the XAUTHORITY variable (without which any graphical program cannot run). The installer automatically elevates itself using su(do).
- If you recieve a "Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display" error when trying to run the installer, ensure that xhost is installed on your system then try to run the installer again.
- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features of the required command line tools).
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains about being unable to load a particular library, then you likely do not have the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialized requirements that the installer does not serve out of the box, then please use the manual installation instructions on the Pale Moon for Linux site (http://linux.palemoon.org/help/installation/).
- For further information, please check the pminstaller release notes or visit the forum (see links below).
